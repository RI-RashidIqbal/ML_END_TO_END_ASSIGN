# ML_END_TO_END_ASSIGN
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning end to end pipeline, covering the entire process from data cleaning to deployment. The pipeline is divided into five main parts:

    Data Cleaning: Preprocess and clean the dataset to make it suitable for model training.
    Model Building: Train a machine learning model on the cleaned data.
    Model Saving and Loading: Save the trained model and load it for later use.
    FastAPI Endpoint for the Model: Create a FastAPI endpoint to serve the model for predictions.
    Deployment with UI: Deploy the FastAPI application and create a user interface (UI) using Gradio or Streamlit, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.
